write a program for working on comparison operators take two inputs and perform all comparsion operations.
a=int(input("enter value of a:"))
b=int(input("enter value of b:"))
print("a greater than b is:",a>b)
print("a less than b is:",a<b)
print("a equal to b is:",a=b)
print("a not equal to b is:",a!=b)
print(a greater than or equal to b is:,"a>=b)
print(a less than or equal to b is:,"a<=b)
output:
enter value of a:10
enter value of b:20
a greater than b is :false
a less than b is:true
a equal to b is:false
a not equal to b is:true
a greater than or equal to b is :false
a less than or equal to b is :true
